# Scanner for product and gas calculations and Chapter 10 notes
Chapter 10 - Numbers and statics: Numbers matter- The Math class does not need instance variables in order to be able to run. The method acts on the argument that you pass through it instead. The math class doesn't have any instance variables, in fact you couldn't make an instance of the class if you tried to. You can never make "new" math object you will recieve an error. For non static methods or regular methods you must create an object and use the reference variable to call on the method. (car.startVehicle(ferarri)) . WHile with a static method you must use the class name instead (Math.min(23,45,56)). Speaking of, some of the other methods in the Math class include Math.random(), Math.abs(), Math.round(), Math.min(), and Math.max().
